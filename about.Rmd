##RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
###Identifying five prime UTR from massive data
Advisor: Zhenhai Zhang, professor at medical school, Southern Medical University

* Developed a program to identify V gene and Leader gene to measure length of five prime UTR
* Collected statistical data of specific antibody sequences using bio-python.
* Analyzed more than 30,000 sequences, finding out the length of five prime UTR is in normal
distribution.

###Analyzing emotions in live comments
Advisor: Renyu Zhang, Assistant Professor of Operations Management, NYU Global Network

* Applied Nature Language Processing (NLP) to analyze on-screen live comments on Bilibili (Chinese version of Twitch) to evaluate the audience's emotional responses.
* Used web crawler to capture live comments and their time stamps from the website
* Selected cyber slang from large amount of comments and assigned numerical values to
emotional words based on repeated experiments.
* Calculated the values of the emotional responses based on live comments as a description of audience's instantaneous reactions

###Finding the area of para-carcinoma tissue
Advisor: Yanxin Luo, Professor at medical school, SYSU

* Established a LASSO regression model to identify the area of para-carcinoma tissue based on
the analysis of important features such as gray level co-occurrence of CT and MRI
* Used 3D-slicer and pyradiomics analyze CT and MRI images
